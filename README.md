**Problem Statement:**

The objective of this project is to provide individuals with an estimation of their required insurance coverage based on their personal health circumstances. Subsequently, customers can collaborate with any health insurance provider and consider their plans and benefits while keeping the projected cost from our analysis in mind. This can help individuals focus on the health-related aspects of an insurance policy rather than the less effective components.

**Dataset:**

The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle. You can access and download the dataset from this location.

**Approach:**

Employing machine learning techniques such as data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and model testing to develop a solution that can predict the premium for personal health insurance.

**Data Exploration: **

Conducting an analysis of the dataset using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, and seaborn.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Generating various graphs to gain insights into the dependent and independent variables/features.
Feature Engineering: Scaling down numerical features and encoding categorical features.
Model Building: Splitting the dataset and training models using different machine learning algorithms, including:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
KNN
Model Selection: Evaluating all the models based on RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-squared values.
Pickle File: Selecting the model with the best RMSE score and R-squared value, and creating a pickle file using the pickle library.
Webpage & Deployment: Developing a web application that collects user inputs and displays the output. The project is then deployed on the Heroku platform
